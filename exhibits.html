<p>For Gamut Gallery’s fourth annual “C4W: Call 4 Works” juried art exhibition, LGAL gallery founder and artist Lindsay Nohl has selected artwork from twenty-four artists out of a diverse pool of submissions. Hailing from a background of illustration and design, choosing work that communicated well was a top priority. The artists selected for the show represent confident creators whose artistic voices were strong, vibrant and intentional in the way they handled their media and craftsmanship.</p>

<p>Though no theme is required in the original submission guidelines, each C4W curator has brought to the table their own unique perspective of and interpretation to the submitted works. This personalized stamp establishes an underlying theme or recurring motif that is a connective thread weaving together the exhibition. Throughout the selection process, Nohl was drawn to the elements of intention and communication, which can be seen in the clear and clever representation of emotions, stories and moments in the final chosen body of work. In each piece, the viewer can sense the personal behind the presented.</p>

<p>“There’s always something very revealing about a personal body of work — it’s a self portrait without being a self portrait,” Nohl said about her selection. “Each work speaks volumes of the creator’s intentions, and their thoughtfulness in the execution of their themes. This body of work is a mix of very representational works amongst stylized illustrative work, and abstract pieces with collage and photography. I believe the works chosen are both strong pieces alone and within the context of the group exhibition.”</p>

<p>Join us for an exhibit that highlights the concepts of readability and response, examining the mindset that you cannot separate the choices an artist makes in their approach to a piece from the final product. It’s all part of the work.</p>

			<p><h1><b>Valure (Va’ lure: to value) // A collection of artwork by women that explores body image and beauty, societal pressures, the subconscious and death.</b></p></h1>

			<p><h1>FEATURED ARTISTS //
			Bethany Birnie, Bunny Portia, Caitlin Karolczak, Jane Wunrow, and Serah Sauser</p></h1>

<p>Amidst the upheaval of 2016, one of the many things that remain uncertain as we enter a year with the new President-elect is how women’s rights will be affected. With this in mind, our inaugural show highlights a group of five talented female artists whose work is a challenging, powerful and visible reminder that women will not be silenced or devalued in the art world and beyond.</p>

<p>For Valure, five artists set out to deconstruct the confines of the idealized “feminine” and explore what it means to value the self while living within a society which places a taboo on aging and an endless fascination on youth. Influenced by dreams, individual identity and the metamorphosis of the body, this collection of work honors the physical, valuing life outside of the scope of the day-to-day.</p>

<p>Juxtaposing dismembered images with illustrations of overgrowth, Jane Wunrow’s abstract works create a collage fluidity, jumping between the physical world and the Divine ambiguity. In the same vein, Karolczak’s soft-lensed, anatomical disfigurations act as the connective tissue between the somatic and the caprice. In both, the ephemeral is present but the outcome of death looms like an ominous apparition, lightly-hued and visually arresting.</p>

<p>Highlighting demonstrations of beauty through a voyeuristic gaze, artist Serah Sauser’s photographs invite us into a couture fantasy dipped in aberrancy. While Bethany Birnie’s whimsically macabre taxidermy pieces take callously discarded, ordinary roadkill and – with Frankenstein-esque creativity – reconstruct them into something dreamlike. By honoring the mortal chassis of these displaced animals, she places worth on their life, both past and in their fantastical metamorphosis.</p>

<p>A series of reflective, autobiographical paintings inspired by her summer job as a Playboy Bunny in the 70’s, Bunny Portia’s works are of the genre “Memento Mori,” which loosely translates into “remember that you will die.” Through photos of the “ideal figure” overlapping medical x-ray imagery, her paintings are intended as a symbolic reminder of the impermanence of beauty, including the arc of aging and mortality.</p>

<p>Though each artist’s unique experience is apparent, their visual connection is a transcendent journey into the various ways society, culture and our own bias shape and often distort identity.</p>
